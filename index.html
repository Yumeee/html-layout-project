      <h2> The Slow Death of Internet Explorer and the Future of Progressive Enhancement
      </h2>
      <h4> by <a href=""> Oliver Williams </a>
      </h4>
      <p>Should our development practices be hemmed in by the gaping chasm between Internet Explorer and every other major browser? Or should we dash into the future leaving IE users behind? Oliver Williams argues for a middle ground: We can make life easier for ourselves without breaking the backward compatibility of the web.

Three experts—Mozilla’s Jen Simmons, publication design legend Roger Black, and ALA’s Jeffrey Zeldman—discuss typography and layout on today’s web: where we are now, and where we’re going.
